# Localisation Management

A UI to export/import and enable/disable languages is available at: `/admin/localisations`:

## Localisation UI (external users)

![Localisation](images/localisation-ui.png)

It is recommended to use a Google sheet (or Excel spreadsheet) to manage the available languages and keep them up-to-date with the current application strings. Currently we have been using this (private) Google spreasheet to keep the localisation used per project: [Localisation Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RE80Rqm5_TI3k1ibm9C5gEyGjk9l91Od4244D6gZqCw)

Workflow for exporting and importing could be as follows:

### For initial setup:

- Export a CSV of languages using the app
- In Google Sheets, select "Import" from the "File" menu
- Select the "Upload" tab and drag the CSV file in
- In the import dialog that appears:
  - Select "Create new spreadsheet"
  - **UN-check** "Convert text to numbers, dates, and formulas"
  - Click "Import data", then click "Open now"

- Once the sheet has loaded, make it look useable:
  - Give it a sensible name
  - Set column widths to appropriate amounts
  - Freeze the 5 header rows (and make the top row **bold**)
  - Select all, then "Format" -> "Wrapping" -> "Wrap

### For subsequent updates:

- Export as CSV from page
- In your existing Google Sheet, "Import" CSV:
  - Select "Replace current sheet" for "import location"
  - **UN-check** "Convert text to numbers, dates, and formulas"
- Import and data will be update. Browse, edit accordingly
- Export by "File -> Download -> CSV"
- Re-import using UI!

## Localisation development

To have access to our context file with all the strings to be localised just import `contexts/Localisation`. Note that you would need to be inside a React component or React hook to be allowed to be using the localisations hook. For fixed enum (defined in the Database) localisation import the `utils/hooks/useLocalisedEnums` file.

### How localisation works?

The app always come with the file `defaultLanguageStrings.js` file which has all the keys of localisation and the base English strings to be used - in case there is a gap on the **main** language to be used (missing key) or even missing the language file... To define other languages to be used is usually done by exporting the existing languages and reimporting with a new language and its strings to be used on the App (as explained before on **Localisation UI (external users)**). In the app the files for localisation are stored in the folder in the server: `./files/localisation` after being imported from one snapshot (`./localisations`).

### Localisations directory

 Contains one languages configuration file `languages.json` and each language folders each containing one file `strings.json` with a map of strings (key) and localised text. The configuration file is easy to follow, and relates to the other language folder in the same directory:
 ```
 [
  {
    "languageName": "English",
    "description": "NZ English",
    "code": "en_nz",
    "flag": "ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "languageName": "Portugese",
    "description": "Portugese translations",
    "code": "pt_br",
    "flag": "ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·",
    "enabled": false
  },
  {
    "languageName": "English",
    "description": "Certain string replacements for DTAC scholarship",
    "code": "en_dtac",
    "flag": "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
 ```

 The configuration file bascially has which languages are selectable by the user (`enabled` option), which how it displays to be user for selecion. In case only one language is available, the user don't the 'Language selection' option on the UI. In other cases it will display as the following:
