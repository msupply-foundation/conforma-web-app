## Overview

The list of applications to display for the current user is based on:

- its permissions to view a certain group of applications
- the application type (aka template code)
- other optional filters selected

The user has access to links to see each type of application list from the top menu or from their dashboard - the link will set basic filters in the main URL route of the list: `/applications`.
For example to see the list of Applications for "Drug Registration" applied by you has this link: `/applications?type=user-registration&user-role=applicant`.

The `type` is the template code related to the applications type to be listed.
The `user-role` is used to determine which columns should be displayed.
In this example the user has **applicant** role. The user-role can only be `applicant` or `reviewer` and is deduced from the permissions that the current user has to view this application type.

## Filters

The file `applicationFilters` on the frontend controls the settings for how filters are displayed. They use the localised string to show keys and values to be selected.

A dropdown is displayed for the user by clicking on the option displayed on the top of the Applications list:

![Filters-keys](images/Filters-for-Applications-keys.png)

Each filter type can be selected by the user, it will be displayed on the right alongside to others previously selected. Some filters, already defined with property `default` set to true will be already available in the top area:

![Filters-defaults](images/Filters-for-Applications-defaults.png)

The user can select the value to filter by after clicking on one of the filter and check one or more of the options that are displayed:

## Formats & Rules

### Pre-defined dates

`today`, `yesterday`, `this-week`, `last-week`, `this-month`, `last-month`, `this-quarter`, `last-quarter`,`this-year`, `last-year`, ...

(Add other pre-defined date here)

### Strings

Can't have special caracters.
Are case insensitive. So `thisTHAT` = `THISthat` = `thisthat`.

### Labels

When combined labels are used (with separator `,`) the query will be using the OR connector.

### General

When combined filters are used (with separator `&`) the query will be using the AND connector.  
Filters that aren't provided would be considered as fetch ALL.  
A few filters should automatically used (example page number) and would be in the query filters mirroring the current displayed query.
