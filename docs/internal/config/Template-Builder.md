# Template Builder

TODO
## General tab

### Displayed options

#### canApplicantMakeChangess

**Optional** Default: **true**.
When this option is set to false it means no Reviewer can interact with Applicant, so option for "List of Questions" is hidden.

### Notes (things to remember to document)

- Hyperlinks in email need to be proper Markdown links and not just rely on native email client text parsing. (Not really a Template Builder issue, but probably need to mention somewhere)
