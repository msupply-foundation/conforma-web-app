# Lookup tables

## Viewing lookup tables

Lookup tables contain data which may be referenced by the application form. 

### To view the list of lookup tables: 

1. Go to Admin Configurations > Lookup Tables
**Note:** only the Admin user is configured to access lookup tables in this demo

### To view the contents of a lookup table: 
1. Click on the eye icon for the lookup table you wish to view. 

## Creating lookup tables
Lookup tables are added to the system by importing csv files. 

### To create a new lookup table: 
1. Click on the ‘Add new lookup table’ button
2. Select your csv file to import. 
**Note:** When adding a csv file for the first time you should not include an ‘ID’ column. 
3. Give the table a name and click on the ‘Import CSV’ button

The lookup table is now imported and available to be referenced by application forms. 

## Editing lookup tables
Lookup tables may be edited in 2 ways: 
a. Editing an existing row
b. Adding a new row

### To edit an existing row: 
1. Export the lookup table csv file by clicking on the orange export button: 
2. Make the updates to the row and save the csv.
3. Click on the ‘Import lookup table’ button and select your amended csv file to import. 

The lookup table will now be updated with the amended row. 

### To add a new row: 
1. Perform the same steps as above to edit an existing row with the following difference: 
    a. Add the new row to the bottom and do not populate the ID column

After importing the system will assign an ID value and the new row will be available for reference.
