## Welcome to mFlow.
mFlow was designed to be used by medicines (and other products) regulatory authorities in low and middle income countries. However, its flexibility means that it could concievably be used in a wide range of situations. For clarity, this guide focuses on its intended use, and guidance on using mFlow in other situations is in the other uses chapter near the end.

mFlow's development was kindly sponsored by the Australian Governments Dept for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Creating mFlow has been a labour of love- thousands of hours of work. We hope you find it a joy to use, and that it results in your regulatory organisation being able to perform its role accurately, quickly and to a high standard.

### What can it do?
mFlow's flexibility makes this a hard question to answer! Here's what you might typical configure mFlow to handle:

* New users can register in the system.
* Applicants for registration can
  * Set up companies
  * Apply for licenses for those companies to operate
  * Once licensed to operate, then apply to register products in any number of categories.
* Regulators can
  * Set up users who have various permissions to review and respond to various types of applications.
  * Set up customisable review processes for different types of products
  * See incoming applications
  * Assign those applications to reviewers
* Reviewers can
  * Review applications for conformity to requirements
  * Respond to applicants via the system explaining non-conformity, or asking for more information.
* Managers can
  * Approve or reject reviews. Approvals can be configured to produce certificates and to inform users
  * Use the mFlow dashboard to 
    * See an overview of work in progress, performance metrics over time, by reviewer, by applicant and so on.
    * View lists of registered products, their categories, their status, etc.
