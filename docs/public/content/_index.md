## mFlow - Medical Forms, Licensing and Organisational Workflows

Welcome to **mFlow** - an open-source, flexible pharmaceutical information management system designed with healthcare regulatory frameworks in mind.  

mFlow has been developed by the team at [The mSupply Foundation](https://msupply.foundation/about) - a friendly bunch who aim to create useful, open-source software in order to improve healthcare solutions in low to middle-income countries. 

Creating mFlow has been a labour of love â€” thousands of hours of work. We hope you find it a joy to use, and that it results in your regulatory organisation being able to perform its role accurately, quickly and to a high standard.

mFlow's development was kindly sponsored by the [Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade](https://www.dfat.gov.au/).

## What can it do?

mFlow provides a platform to:

- Create application forms
- Manage complex application lifecycle workflows
- Assign roles and permissions to users
- Monitor the status of groups of applications
- Catalogue outcomes of applications

Some examples of regulatory frameworks where mFlow is currently being used: 

- New Drug Registrations
- Pharmaceutical Company Licensing
- Medicine Import / Export Permits

mFlow's flexibility means that it can be used in a wide range of situations. For clarity, this guide focuses on its intended use in healthcare regulatory environments. Suggestions for use of mFlow in other situations can be found in the [Uses of mFlow](/getting-started/uses-for-mflow/) chapter.
