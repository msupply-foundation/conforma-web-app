The original inspiration for creating mFlow was to provide a low-cost tool to help manage regulatory workflows in the healthcare industry.

However, mFlow could be used for almost any process that involves an application and a response from an authority.

Here at [The mSupply Foundation](https://msupply.foundation/about) we're using mFlow for users to apply for our mSupply accreditation course. 

You could concievably use mFlow to manage:
* Driver license applications.
* Membership applications for a club.
* Job applications.
* Visa applications.

We don't want to repeat the whole user guide for you here - we suggest you read the main user guide which is aimed at use in the healthcare regulatory industry, but look at it through the eyes of your own requirements.
