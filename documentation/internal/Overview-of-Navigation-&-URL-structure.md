_This should give us a guide of what UI mockups we need to demonstrate, as well as inform the details of the Navigation links menu._

## `/login`

## `/`

### Home (Dashboard)

“Welcome” page showing a summary of activities in progress, e.g. incomplete applications, incomplete reviews, new notifications, etc.

#### Applicant

Sees all applications they’ve applied for, or maybe others belonging to their organisation. With Columns showing to the applicant: Application number, name, stage,status, outcome and "days since last action". Desirable to see the messages for each application here. Examples:

1. Filtered by application type: [https://balsamiq.cloud/scs7giw/ponj59g/rDA7E](https://balsamiq.cloud/scs7giw/ponj59g/rDA7E)
2. Using other filters: [https://balsamiq.cloud/scs7giw/ponj59g/r08EE](https://balsamiq.cloud/scs7giw/ponj59g/r08EE)

## `/application/new`

### New application launcher

A standard page for creating a new application.

## `/application/[serialNum]/review`

Overview/Start page for reviews of application and reviews of reviews (consolidation). User will see different content depending on review assignments and their respective review. For Reviewers who have assigned content to review, they will have the option to "Start" review, which will create a Review in the database and re-direct to the specific review page. For existing reviews with pending status, slightly different UI will be presented and instead of "Start", "Continue" button will be shown.

This page will have mutations to `create review`, `self-assign review assignment`, `create review responses`. Logic for these is best described in diagrams, `Response Flow` and `Review and Consolidation URL Flow` ![Diagrams Back End Repo Wiki]https://github.com/openmsupply/application-manager-server/wiki/Database-Schema-Review-And-Consolidation#diagram)

## `/application/[serialNum]/review/[reviewId]`

Specific Review or Consolidation page. Assigned Reviewer(s) can mark questions as "Conform"/"Non-conform" or "Agree"/"Disagree" for consolidation and add comments. Reveiew Decision can also be made ![Review Decision Back End Repo Wiki]https://github.com/openmsupply/application-manager-server/wiki/Database-Schema-Review-And-Consolidation#review-decision)

This diagram is also useful for this URL `Review and Consolidation URL Flow` ![Diagrams Back End Repo Wiki](https://github.com/openmsupply/application-manager-server/wiki/Database-Schema-Review-And-Consolidation#diagram)

## `/application/[serialNum]/assignment`

_Assigment URLs to be decided_

### Application assignment mode

The “home page” of a specific application during assignment of reviewers.

The Supervisor -- with the proper permission to assign reviewers -- can do the assignment of reviewers to one (or more) section when the application is submitted to a new stage (the assignment changes per stage). After assigned the reviewers can review the specific sections.

### Footnotes

<a name="note1">[Note 1](#n1root)</a>: The use of `>` in the query string is not really going to work unless we write our own parser. Probably best to just define fields such as `priorityGreaterThan=10`.
