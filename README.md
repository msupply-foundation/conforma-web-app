## Usage

* Install dependencies (Using node >=v13.8.0):

`yarn install`

`cd src/formElementPlugins/ && yarn install`

* Run on development mode:

`yarn dev`

* Bundle for production:

`yarn build`

* Serve bundled App:

`yarn serve`

## Development

* `main` branch - only has features which have been released (on a demo-tag)
* `develop` - to be used for development (to create a feature-branch before making a new PR) and selected as base for PRs

The organisation-team will transfer approved changes from `develop` into the `main` periodically once all new features are stable and tested.

## Connecting to server

In development, by default, the app will try to connect to local servers on `http://localhost:8080` (for REST server) and `http://localhost:5000/graphql` (GraphQl), so you'll need to have the [back-end](https://github.com/openmsupply/conforma-server) running.

It's possible to connect to a remote/online server by specifying it a local `.env` file (not committed with repo) in the repo root. An example `.env` file might look like:

```
# Angola testing server
# REMOTE_SERVER=https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50008

# Demo server
REMOTE_SERVER=https://conforma-demo.msupply.org:50000

```

(Only the base url is required -- the full REST and GraphQL server urls will be constructed in `config.ts`)

To disable servers, just comment out the line (with `# `). When they're all disabled, the default `localhost` will be used.
