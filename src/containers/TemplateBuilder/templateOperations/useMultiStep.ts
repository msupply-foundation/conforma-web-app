/**
 * Provides a mechanism to track the result of multiple sequential actions (e.g.
 * confirmation modals). Normally, in React, you can't await the result of a
 * confirmation modal as you have to pass in an `onConfirm` callback, which
 * can't return its result to the original calling component. When you have more
 * than one modal in sequence, particularly if there's branching logic based on
 * the result of those modals, you can quickly end up in Callback hell.
 *
 * There are solutions to create a promise-based hook that allows you to await
 * the result of a confirmation, e.g.
 * https://daveteu.medium.com/react-custom-confirmation-box-458cceba3f7b
 *
 * However, the solution offered here is a simpler option which just allows you
 * to specify a sequence of actions (a "workflow") and pass the state along from
 * one to the next. The actions themselves are responsible for calling the
 * `nextStep()` method and checking conditions.
 *
 * See `useTemplateOperations` to see how this hook is used.
